# Directory CLeaner Bot
This bot (fancier name for script :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:) analyses your files present in a directory by their extension and then creates a folder for each file type and organizes them into their respective folders, and already present libraries untouched.
### ToDos
- [ ] Implement other ways of file sorting such as by modification date etc.

#### Note: Tested only on mac. To be tested on linux and windows. Although it should work.
